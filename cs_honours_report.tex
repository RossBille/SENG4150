\noindent The abstract summarises the content of the paper or report and should have 70-200 words (depending on the publisher or other requirements); It
should state briefly what the paper is about (maybe also what
methods were used), what its (new) results are, why it is
important or significant. It can also be useful to state (or
indicate implicitly) who is the addressed readership and whether
its a review article, a short paper, a pilot study, an
extension of previous work or a thesis. Try to avoid special symbols, abbreviations, and citations.

\section{Introduction}

There are different ways to write an introduction. Typically it
contains background information and a review of literature which
indicates how the study fits into the context of other previous
work. This way the introduction can  address the significance and importance of the study. Major related publications in big journals should be cited
as well as closely related other articles. The literature review typically uses newer papers when it tries to address the state-of-the-art of a technique or recent developments. However, when first mentioning a method name the historically first source that introduced that concept should be cited. There are different citation styles and here is an example~\citep{QuinlanChalupMiddletonACRA2003}. The introduction
typically motivates the general hypotheses, aims and research questions
of a paper, report or thesis.  

\begin{center}
\begin{boxit}
\textbf{The research question is important.}
\end{boxit}
\end{center}

Questions raised in the introduction can later be answered in the final discussion.

The introduction often ends with a brief overview of the structure or organisation of
the paper, report or thesis.
